The following visualization was created using the Spotify Hit Predictor Dataset from Kaggle.

All of the songs used to produce the visualization were songs that were featured at least once on Billboards Hot 100 list. Hence, making the song a "hit"

The audio features (valence, energy etc.) come from the Spotify Web API
